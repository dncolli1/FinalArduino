This is my project statement. My input is a photoresistor. My output is a LED RGB. I combined them because it has a fun Holiday ending. It is wired and coded for the LED RGB to start out white, then you change the amount of light measured in the photoresistor and it changes from red to green as you allow more light into the photoresistor. The circuit is functional because all the wires are where they should be and the code is correct. The cercuit is creative as it pertains to Christmas. This is how I envision people replicating my project. I envision this project to also include these peripherals: maybe a lightbulb, or more than one LED RGB, or something else.
